# Shopping-List
Built a to-do list using the PERN stack

Following Brad Traversy's MERN stack tutorial to better understand the relationship between the frontend and the backend.
I followed this tutorial, instead using Postgres instead of MongoDB to better test my knowledge and get more familiar.

Oh and he implemented redux and authentication too!

This is more like a shopping list where a user can register and also login to have a sheet, in the form of a list, where he can make a list of things he intends to get. He can also delete the items from the list.
